Big numbers in a small library
=============================

Arbitrary precision integer arithmetic in a C++ library with absolutely no dependencies.

This code is old and abandoned, originally written for VC++ 7.1.


What it is
----------

The goal was to implement RSA-capable app with as little footprint as possible. The focus was on smallest code, not performance.

This is mostly ad-hoc code, with no optimizations.

Some discussion happened in this thread: http://rsdn.ru/forum/src/931893

The following book explains multi-precision arithmetic with improved algorithms, not implemented in this library:
